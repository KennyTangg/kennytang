### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Kenny! I am a Computer Science undergraduate. I enjoy learning how computers work and building projects that deepen my understanding of programming. I also like problem-solving and exploring new programming concepts and discovering different areas of tech.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy watching movies, cycling, traveling, playing badminton, and listening to soundtrack music.
